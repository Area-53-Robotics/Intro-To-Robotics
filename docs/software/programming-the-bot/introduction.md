# Programming the Robot

In order to interact with the VEX brain, you will need a library. There are two major ones:

## VEXCode

This is an official library made by VEX. This is guaranteed to work for as long as VEX exists. This can be used either with it's own IDE (Integrated Development Environment, fancy word for code editor) called VEXCode Pro, or with Microsoft's VSCode.

There is also a normal VEXCode IDE, which lets you code with blocks, similar to Scratch. However, if you use this, all programmers will instantly lose all respect for you.

### Installation

VEXCode Pro:

-   [Download](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/pro-v5)

VSCode Extension:

-   [VSCode Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## PROS

This is an unofficial library maintained by the students at Purdue University. It is somewhat harder to use, however it provides an experience close to what you would find in an actual C++ project. The documentation is much better written, and the library is much more powerful. It is open source, which means that development happens much faster, and that even you could contribute.

PROS has a build in template manager, which has resulted in many libraries written for it, including:

-   Sylib
-   Ryanlib
-   Okapilib
-   ARMS
-   LEGS
-   EZ Template

### Installation

It is recommended to use the VSCode extension to use PROS, but there is a CLI (command line interface) if you have a different editor that you prefer.
