# Basics

All of our robots are programming in C++, so a basic familiarity with it is required. The following concepts are required to be able to program a robot:

-   Variables
-   Datatypes
-   Operators
-   Scope
-   Control Flow
-   Functions
-   Header files
-   Classes and Objects

If you are unfamiliar with C++, we recommend that you look at [this](https://www.learncpp.com/) tutorial. The tutorial itself is quite long, and not all of it will be needed for the basics of robotics, so we recommend that you read these excepts first:

-   [Introduction to objects and variables](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-objects-and-variables/)
-   [Variable assignment and initialization](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/variable-assignment-and-initialization/)
-   [Introduction to fundamental data types](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-fundamental-data-types/)
-   [Introduction to literals and operators](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-literals-and-operators/)
-   [Comments](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/comments/)
-   [Introduction to functions](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-functions/)
-   [Introduction to local scope](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-local-scope/)
-   [Introduction to if statements](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-if-statements/)
-   [Introduction to loops and while statements](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-loops-and-while-statements/)
-   [Introduction to the preprocessor](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-the-preprocessor/)
-   [Header files](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/header-files/)
-   [Header Guards](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/header-guards/)
-   [Welcome to object oriented programming](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/welcome-to-object-oriented-programming/)
-   [Classes and class members](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/classes-and-class-members/)

Of course, we highly recommend that you try to read the whole tutorial, but this should be enough to get you started.
