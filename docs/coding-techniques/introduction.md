# Coding Techniques

For coding I’m not an expert, but our best coders wrote this lesson up. I’ll turn it to Gavin from 53C and Kevin from 53A.

Coding is a crucial part of robotics. Building may create robots, but coding is what actually brings life to them. Even if you plan on being a builder, it’s important to know at least some basic coding to be able to familiarize yourself with your team’s code as well as solve simple problems in the absence of a coder. In this section we’ll teach you the general coding knowledge you’ll need to be able to create effective and working programs for robotics.
