# Control Theory

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory):

> Control theory is a field of control engineering and applied mathematics that deals with the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any delay, overshoot, or steady-state error and ensuring a level of control stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality.

Precision is everything in robotics, and control theory is the mathematics of making robots precise. As stated above, control theory usually deals with moving a system to a target. This could be anything, driving the robot to a point on the field, turning an arm to a certain rotation, or even getting a flywheel to a certain speed. As long as you have a sensor and a system you can control, you can apply control theory.

Nothing in this section is required to make your robot work, but it can make your programming extremely efficient and precise, especially during the autonomous period.
