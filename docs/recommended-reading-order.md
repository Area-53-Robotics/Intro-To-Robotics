## Freshman Year

- [Introduction](./introduction.md)
- [The Basics](./the-basics/tools.md)
- [Subsystems](./subsystems/drivetrains.md)
- Builders: [Building Techniques](./building-techniques/stationary.md)
- Coders: [Coding Techniques]()
- Drivers: [Driving Techniques]()

- [The Tournament]()

In your freshman year, you aren’t expected to be the lead builder, lead coder, lead driver, or lead notebooker, but if you’re looking into it, you should start learning. Your freshman year is also about making mistakes in order to improve. You aren’t expected to lead your team through a season or a tournament, but you are expected to learn, so that you will have the experience and confidence to lead when you are older. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions, it’s more important that you build your knowledge through practice.

## Junior Year

- Leaders: [Leading Techniques]()
- Club Leaders: [Theory]()

In your junior year, one member of your team should probably be taking the leading role. They’re big shoes to fill - leaders need to have a grasp of all aspects of robotics and need to be able to guide and empower their team. Read Leading Techniques.
Many times, devoted members want to restructure the club because they don’t like X, Y, and Z. These people don’t have to be the leaders of teams, but a large group of devoted members will be able to make positive changes. Read Theory.
