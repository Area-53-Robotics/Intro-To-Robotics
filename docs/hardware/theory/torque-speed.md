# Torque and Speed

## Torque

Torque is rotational force. Torque can be calculated with the following equation:

Assuming that:

-   $\tau$ is torque, measured in newton meters (N-m)
-   $r$ is the distance to the center of rotation, measured in meters (m)
-   $F$ is the force applied to the object, measured in newtons (N)

$$
\tau=r*F
$$

This means that the farther out force is applied, the greater torque is. This means it is easier to move something the farther away from the center of rotation. This is why doorknobs are as far as possible away from the hinges as possible. Torque is relevant whenever you have a rotation system, usually when you have a motor involved. Torque is typically important whenever you need to lift heavy objects, or quickly accelerate.

## Speed (RPM)

Speed is, obviously, how fast something moves. We'll be focusing on rotational speed, measured in rotations per minute (RPM). This can be calculated quite simply as the amount of full rotations made around the center of rotations in a minute.

## Relationship

Torque and speed are strongly correlated. You can use these equations to calculate the relationship between speed and torque.

Assuming that:

-   $P$ is power
-   $\tau$ is torque
-   $S$ is speed

$$
P=\tau*S
$$

$$
\tau=P/S
$$

$$
S=P/\tau
$$

Power is the amount of energy transferred over time. Given a system where power is constant, torque and speed are inversely proportional. This means that the more torque you have, the less speed you have, and vice versa. The easier it is to move your system, the slower you go, and the harder it is to move your system, the faster you go.

If you've ever ridden a bike with a gearshift, you've experienced this firsthand. In the lowest gear its very easy to move, but you can't go very fast. As you increase what gear you're in, it becomes much harder to pedal, but you can go much faster.
