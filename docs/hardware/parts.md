# Parts

There are many different types of parts that can be used in vex robotics.

## Structure

This category includes the parts that make up the body of your robot.

You can learn more about the structural components [here](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/hardware/misc.-vex-parts-1/structure).

## Motion

This category has everything that is designed to help with making things move on the robot. This includes things like wheels, axles, gears, and chain. However, it does not include actuators like motors and pneumatic pistons, which are in the electronics and pneumatics categories respectively.

## Electronics

This category of parts includes things like batteries, the robot's brain, and motors.

There are also several types of sensors that can be used, which you can learn about [here](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/vex-electronics/vex-sensors).

## Pneumatics

This category of parts includes things components that use air to create motion.
