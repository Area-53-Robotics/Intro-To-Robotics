# Canteleveration

Canteleveration is a big word so let’s break it down. Cante: Spanish word for sing in first person singular. Lever: lots of force on one side. Basically, it’s a structure that’s only supported on 1 side. This can range anywhere from axles to C-Channel. Axles are obvious because you need to support each side with metal and bearings. There is one exception here: You can have one side of the axle exposed if there are 2 pieces of metal supporting the other end. C-Channel is a bit more obscure because if you joint it properly, it might not need the extra support. But, if it’s able to be supported, it’s probably worth doing.

I accidentally canteleverated a bearing block. I was only able to screw in 1 side of the bearing because of lack of spacing for the other screw head. The axle was in the middle. There was so much weight on the axle that it pushed the bearing down. Canteleveration extends to jointing small things too.
