Please follow the instructions below to download the product:

1.  Go to: [www.solidworks.com/SEK]() and complete the form (first name, last name email address, select “student team” on dropdown)

2.  Under product information:

    -   Ask someone in the club for a serial number
    -   Select Yes ( I already have a serial number)

    -   Input your serial number

If you do not activate the license after installing, you will only receive a 30-day license. Please give this serial number out to team members only. This serial number will expire July 31, 2024.
