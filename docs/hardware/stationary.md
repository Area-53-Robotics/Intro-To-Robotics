# Stationary

Our first topic is stationary relations. This includes a lot of metal to metal contact and objects that are stationary relative to the object they’re attached to. Most of the framework for your robot is here, while the magic that makes it move is in the next section.

## Nylocks vs Crowns (Keps)

Use Nylocks when:

-   You’re screwing in a load bearing joint (a screw in a nut)
-   You’re using a screw joint
-   Any important connections and if you have them any time you can
-   Use Crowns when:
-   You’re testing designs or you’re going to take them apart
-   You’re in a rush
-   You need to hold spacers in a certain point on a screw (use them like collars)

### Parts:

-   Standoffs - Use them with collars to hold up structures.
-   1x1 L-Channel - Use these as a thin way to hold up structures.
-   C-Channel - Use these as a sturdy way to hold up structures.

### Shapes:

-   Triangles - Create pythagorean triples (3, 4, 5 or 5, 12, 13). Use standoffs or 1x1 L-Channel. Use 90° parts like pillow bearings, collars, or L-Channel to connect standoffs to the post or horizontal structure.
-   Rectangles - Subdivide larger squares into smaller ones. Use standoffs, L-Channel, or C-Channel. These include cross braces that span your drivetrain and hold your braces.

## Balance

Balancing your robot is important to not over-stress your drive motors. If you have too much weight in the back, the motors powering your back wheels will stress in trying to carry the weight. Some things you need to consider:
Where the weight is in your robot w/o game parts
Where the weight is in your robot w/ game parts
If your center of gravity is high or low
How force affects your robot
Getting pushed from the front, side, or back
Mechanisms that produce substantial force usually through rubber bands

### How to fix it:

-   Careful Planning - When designing your robot, try to ensure your robot has a low center of gravity. This can be done by keeping as much of the weight low to the ground as possible. In particular, you want to keep as many of your motors low to the ground as possible, along with your robot’s brain and battery. If your robot has steel pieces, they should also be low to the ground.
-   Counterweights - These are mostly steel plates or C-Channels. If you have too much weight in the back, add plates in the front, or add a steel C-Channel as a brace in the front. If your robot is top heavy, you could replace some of your drivetrain C-Channel for steel. Put your counterweights where the actual weight isn’t.
-   Anti-Tips - These are used commonly with DR4Bs (double-reverse-4-bars) or long extensions of your robot. These are basically another set of wheels that extend from either the front or back of the robot. Usually they are a smaller set of wheels (3.25 in or 2.75in), rubber band-wrapped gears, or even pulley wheels (they’re hard to find). Sometimes they’ll extend using linear slides, others will flip out from the sides or back.

## Custom Parts

You are allowed to create certain parts in robotics. All of these have been mentioned in parts. Here we’ll elaborate more on lexan and custom metal.
Lexan is a bendable plastic that you can use. It can create better curves than metal (in this competition) because you don’t have to bend it by hand. It can also create better gussets.
You aren’t allowed to use sheet metal in robotics, but there are a few ways around it. You can cut C-Channel or plates into different shapes to fit your needs. You can bend it to create curves, they aren’t as good as lexan though.
Understanding how to manipulate your lexan and metal will help you create better parts that fit your robot how you need them.
