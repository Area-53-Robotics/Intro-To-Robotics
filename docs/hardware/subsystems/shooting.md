# Shooting

Shooting mechanisms are interesting because you have to increase the velocity of a normally stationary object. You sometimes have to generate enough energy to push an object, meaning that you have to get your force and accuracy down.

## Catapult

Catapults generate a lot of force because of the rubber bands, so make sure they’re properly structured not to break. They are also difficult because the launch point (when the object leaves the catapult), determines where the object goes. You also need to perfect your slip gear, how many teeth you need to remove, because that determines how much power your catapult has. These take a lot of testing to perfect, but can carry a lot of objects.

## Puncher

Punchers use a linear arm to strike an object. They generate a lot of force, and are more repeatable than catapults. They also take up little space. The difficulty in punchers lay in how you angle them. You can have one angle and move your robot, or you can have an angler that moves your puncher. A high-level puncher is very hard to make, but very beautiful when it works.

## Flywheel

Wheel spin fast. That’s it.

You need to make sure that your wheel can spin fast enough and that the ball can fly well. The hood angle is important because it determines where the ball goes. The compression on a flywheel is very important. Compression is the distance between two objects that help intake or shoot an object. If there is too much compression then the object will not travel very far because of the large amounts of friction. If there is too little there will not be enough force to shoot the object. This makes flywheels difficult to build well. Flywheels can shoot very far and are the most repeatable because they are almost always active.
