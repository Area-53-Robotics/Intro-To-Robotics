The drivetrain is THE important part of your robot and should be the first thing you take time to think out. Most of this is covered in the video although I wanted to highlight them here.Your drivetrain needs:

- 6 dots apart (3 in), will be more for mecanum wheels
- Not 2 gel wheels on one side
- Almost always 2 motors per side
- Internal bracings (standoffs or other small metal braces holding the C-Channel together)
- Around 2 cross-robot bracings (bracings that go across the entire robot)
- When gearing, make sure your wheels spin the same way
- When using sprockets, fine tune your chain tension
- Your drivetrain is important, so build it well. It might take you some time to do it, but it carries your robot, so it better be good.
