Lifts are necessary when you have to extend upwards. They need to be stable and sturdy because the load they carry is often heavy. The cascade lift is a weird lift and it’s not used a lot, but I’ve included a video that explains it. Things you should make sure to have on your lifts:

- Cross bracings (ones that are perpendicular to your lifting bars)
- X bracings (ones that cross your lifting bars)
- Triangle bracings supporting your posts
- Anti tips (we’ll cover this more later, but helps with balance)
- Counter weights (use if needed)
- Screw joints
- Lifts are hard to make, but are very rewarding. Making lifts well is necessary, a good amount of games make your robot extend.
