# Parts

There are a lot of parts. Some are obscure, some are necessary. Everyone should know how to be able to use simple parts well to fit their needs. If you need to use a part once, you should try to learn it fully. These files are very large and take about an hour in total to watch, but they should have all the knowledge you need to know about parts.

> Note: I forgot about a “rail”, it’s basically a worse C-Channel. I would only use them for bracing

## Custom and NonVEX Parts

### Slip Gears

- This is made from any plastic Vex gear.
- Used for lots of shooting mechanisms.
- When the gear is spun, it’ll drive another gear when the teeth connect, but when the flat side of the slip gear contacts the gear, the driven gear won’t move (or move into position of least tension).

### Ratchets

  I couldn’t find a good picture of a ratchet, so here are 2 videos showing them.
  Ratchets are useful because they will only turn in one direction.
  Normally you have a 60 tooth gear with a screw insert, and a 12 tooth gear or 6 tooth sprocket (both with axle inserts) on an axle. You also have a rubber banded screw directly attached to the 60 tooth, which contacts the 12 or 6 tooth at an angle. When the 12 or 6 tooth turns, it will either brush over the head of the screw and not turn the 60 tooth, or push the screw and turn the 60 tooth.

### Lexan

- Clear plastic used for custom shapes.
- Many teams use this to create gussets for different angles or because the Vex ones suck.
- Lexan can also be bent.
- Must be cut from a 12” x 24” x 0.07” sheet.

### Rubber bands

- Used to hold systems in place, propel systems, open systems, or give support to motors.
- Common uses:
  - Holding in anti-tips (wheels that prevent tipping)
  - Shooting mechanisms
  - Expanding trays
  - Holding up lifts
  - Advantage brand rubber bands are the best.

### Zip Ties

- Used to hold wires or other small systems in place.
- Should not be used structurally, be can in a pinch.
- Mainly used for wire management.
- My team once used them to hold our anti-tips in, not a good idea.

### String

- Unlimited amount of ⅛” braided, nylon rope.
- Used to hold systems in place against tension.

### Tape

- Used for wire management, or as a color for the Light Sensor
- Cannot be used for structural purposes.
