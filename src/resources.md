## CAD

### General Tips

We typically use the parts libraries created by the [VEX CAD Discord server](https://discord.gg/BKV3DJm). This server is also a great resource to meet competitors from different regions and get help and advice on your CADs.

### Fusion 360

A little guide to help you work with Fusion 360.

1. Download Fusion 360 from Autodesk.

- [https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360]()
- Press “Get Fusion 360 For Free”
- Press “Get Started”
- Fill out the form
- Sign up with a personal email.
- You might need to give them proof of a school ID.
- If you don’t have a school ID to take a photo of, take a screenshot of SchoolMax. Make sure the name of the school, your name, and the school year are visible in the image.

2.  Ask someone to add you to the Fusion team.
3.  Once you’re in the team, you’ll see in the upper-left hand corner the Area 53 team.

- Click on this to enter the team.

4. You’ll see some number of folders, this’ll probably increase.

- Any folder of a team name is off limits, you can open the documents but you can’t edit them.
- The VRC parts folder is for everyone’s use and for everyone’s builds. DO NOT edit these parts in the VRC parts folder. If you edit these parts, they will change in every build. If you need to edit them, make a copy of it first then edit it.
- There might be a new members folder. Please create a new folder under this to store your builds.

5.  Look at your toolbar on the top of your screen. If you see something called “VEX CAD LIBRARY” you’re fine, if not download the add-in from below. You don’t have to download anything else.

6. Here’s a tutorial we learned from: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4t7PlxN7GU]()

- Disregard the split body tool for cutting parts, there is a better method (step 5).
